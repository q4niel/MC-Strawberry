# MC Strawberry
A collection of simple <!---batch/-->shell scripts designed to help you download and install a variety of Minecraft assets from their official sources.
This project does not include any assets themselves, but automates the process of fetching them from the official download sites.
These assets are selected based on my personal preference for client-side enhancements that I believe improve the Minecraft experience.

## Install Guide
1. **Prerequisites**:
   The scripts utilizes **curl** for downloads, which should be installed on any relatively modern system.
   Most Linux distributions and macOS have it pre-installed. On Windows, you may need to install it manually.

2. **Download your Script**:
   You can download the scripts from the [releases section](https://github.com/q4niel/MC-Strawberry/releases).
   Please refer to the release notes for specific functionality and changes in each version.

3. **Run your Script**:
    - After downloading, execute the script in a terminal or command prompt from the directory where the script is located.
    - The script will create a new directory in the current working directory.
    - The new directory will contain all the downloaded assets including **shaderpacks**, **resourcepacks**, and **mods**.
    ```
    /MC-Strawberry-XXX-XXX/
        ├── shaderpacks/
        ├── resourcepacks/
        ├── mods/
    ```

## Licensing

It does not distribute any **shaderpacks**, **resourcepacks**, or **mods**.
